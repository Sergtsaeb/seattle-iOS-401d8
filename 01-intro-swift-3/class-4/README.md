# Week 1 - Class 4
## Homework
* Using Playgroundsâ€¦  
  * Declare Enum that conforms to `Error`. Your enum should have at least 5 cases and should use Associated Values for 3 of the 5 cases using the following types:  
    * String  
    * (Int, Int)  
    * ()->()  
  * Declare a `Person` class with 3 member properties. Declare a `Student` subclass that inherits from Person.
    * Both Your Student and Person class should have at least 2 meaningful Type and 2 Instance Methods that would apply to each type. Be creative.
    * In one of these 2 classes(`Student` or `Person`), demonstrate a computed property and implement a property observer.
    * Your `Student` class should have a `student ID` property that is a unique identifier for each student
  * Create a `Classroom` class that is a true singleton and has an array of `Students`.
    * Add *accessor methods*(`add(Student:)`, `remove(Student:)`, `studentWith(id:)-> Student`, `allStudentNames()->[String]`, `studentCount()->Int`) to `Classroom` to access student data from the array.
